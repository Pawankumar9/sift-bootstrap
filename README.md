# SIFT Bootstrap

Ubuntu 14.04 is the only distribution supported by this script.

## DEPRECATED WARNING

This script/repo has been deprecated in favor of managing and installing SIFT using [saltstack](https://github.com/sans-dfir/sift-saltstack). You must use 16.04 going forward to install SIFT using SaltStack or the SIFT CLI.

The preferred method of installation is done via the [SIFT CLI tool](https://github.com/sans-dfir/sift-cli). This command line utility will download and validate install signatures and SHA hashes before installing.
